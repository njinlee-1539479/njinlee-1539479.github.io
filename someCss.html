		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p><font face="verdana" color="purple">My name is Nicole Lee. I was born in Tuscon, Arizona. I lived in Taiwan for the first two years of my life,
		then I moved to Gig Harbor, WA. I have lived here ever since. I am 19 years old. I attend the
		University of Washington in Seattle. I am studying Pre-Nursing, and I just applied this year.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Arial" color="black">If I am not accepted this year, I will take a gap year to travel and study abroad to teach
		children English, while simultaneously learn Spanish. I also want to volunteer when I am
		abroad!</font></p>
